The chatbot is able to use document (PDF) or text as reference for answering incoming question. The method called RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) which consist of three processing: 
1. Indexing - Split, embed, and put the text into vector database (Vectorstore); 
2. Retrieval: Get the particular contents from chunks (some part of splitted relevant document) from Vectorstore; 
3. Generation: Process the retrieval to be human-readable language as answer of the question. 
For seamless communication, i put all of the process to be Back End Service using Fast API.`,

    description: `Managing and monitoring autonomous robotic competitions on via realtime web based platform.

A basestation software platform designed to manage, monitor, and control autonomous robotic competitions for the KRI (Indonesia Robotic Contest) and RoboSoccer Middle Size League.

The product provides a real-time visualization and control interface built with Vue.js, featuring canvas-based field rendering, live robot state updates, and responsive UI design. It supports seamless switching between Node.js and ROS environments, enabling flexible integration with different robotic systems.

On the backend, the system processes high-frequency data streams from multiple robots, aggregates them into global state data, and redistributes this information in real time to both robots and the front-end interface. Communication is optimized using UDP multicast, UDP unicast, and TCP protocols, with buffering and binary encoding to comply with strict bandwidth limitations.

The platform also integrates directly with the referee box, handling match commands and signals and synchronizing them across robots and the visualization layer to ensure accurate, rule-compliant match execution.

This basestation has been validated in national and international robotic competitions, demonstrating stability, real-time performance, and compliance with competition standards.
